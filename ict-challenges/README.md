# 🚀 iCodeThis Challenges

Welcome to the **iCodeThis Challenges** section of my **Web Dev Challenges** repository! 🎨👨‍💻 This folder contains my solutions to challenges from **[iCodeThis](https://www.icodethis.com/)**, where I practice real-world frontend development skills, including **HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, responsive design, accessibility, and semantic best practices**.

## 📌 About iCodeThis

[iCodeThis](https://www.icodethis.com/) provides **daily frontend coding challenges** designed to help developers improve their skills through practical hands-on projects. These challenges are great for learning **UI design, CSS layouts, interactive components, and best coding practices**.

This section of my repository is dedicated to my **learning journey**, where I tackle iCodeThis challenges to sharpen my skills, explore new concepts, and improve my ability to write clean, maintainable code.

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each challenge is organized in its own folder:

```
ict-challenges/
│── challenge-1/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── css/
│   │   ├── styles.css
│   │   ├── styles.min.css
│   ├── scss/
│   │   ├── styles.scss
│   ├── js/
│   │   ├── script.js
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── (images, icons, fonts, etc.)
│   ├── README.md (Details about this specific challenge)
│── challenge-2/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── css/
│   │   ├── styles.css
│   │   ├── styles.min.css
│   ├── scss/
│   │   ├── styles.scss
│   ├── js/
│   │   ├── script.js
│   ├── assets/
│   │   ├── (images, icons, fonts, etc.)
│   ├── README.md
...
```

Each project folder is structured to keep **CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, and assets** organized in separate subfolders for better maintainability. If a challenge uses SCSS, the compiled CSS will be in the `css/` folder, with a **minified version (`styles.min.css`)** for optimized performance.

## 📌 Why am I Hosting Fonts Myself?

Due to **GDPR compliance**, I am **self-hosting all fonts** instead of using third-party services like Google Fonts. When fonts are loaded from external sources, user data such as **IP addresses** can be tracked, which can raise privacy concerns. By hosting fonts locally within the `assets/fonts/` folder, I ensure that no external requests are made, improving both **privacy** and **performance** for users.
